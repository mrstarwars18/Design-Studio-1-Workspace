      "The utopizing tension of the origins of Design must be recovered.If this is an allegory of a possible transformation, then it should
      reach as many people as possible.Those people who build our environment in a state of alienation and thus ramin partially responsible of its transformation.The mechanisms lead by the IT revolution are presently
      devoring all ideas to vomit sellable goods.To begin with, in the next decades we must find the right ways to isolate from this redundancy the transformation ideas. In order to achieve that we must separate them
      from all those ideas that are generated by irresponsible anarchies that deny and trivialise the drive towards the utopia, thus making it impossible to get people involved.
      In the meanwhile, it might be worth generalising the idea that every project works towards ethics (which can be compared to the <a href="https://issuu.com/designdisplacementgroup/docs/the_speculative_manifesto_look_back">Hippocratic Oath.</a>)"
