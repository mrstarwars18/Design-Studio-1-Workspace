      <p>As Designers,we must often question our motives and our passions in order to discover more about our styles,ambitions, and even our works in general. For me personally, This helps me decrypt my process and figure out why I do what I do. I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at the age of 7,and ever since, I have been trying to decrypt my feelings and actions, with the ultimate goal of finding out why I do the things that I do.Having this Mental Disorder has impeded a lot of my social functionality, and I often react in ways that other people donâ€™t really understand or like. After these reactions, I often think about how I reacted, and why I chose to act in the way I did. Ever since I began Designing Art, I have begun to do the same thing with my works. Most of the works I have made draw inspiration from the interests I have gathered over the years, such as Star Wars, Marvel, and various video games. I make these works to show my love for these franchises, and to allow others who love these universes to not only appreciate my art, but to show their love for the worlds and characters that these people have created. My goal is to share my work, have people appreciate and critique it, and (hopefully) inspire them to go out and make their own pieces of art , so that i can say I am like a link in the  chain of creativity, taking inspiration from others,and inspiring others to create their own work, so that the worlds and love for these worlds may continue expanding. I have begun to decipher my motives and reasoning for making these pieces, and I believe I have finally discovered my steps for making these. I have managed to make an acronym out of this process:
      </p>
        <br><h2>CRIMP</h2><br/>
      <p class="p2">Consumption, Research, Ideation, Making, Post-process
      This acronym is fitting for the theme of this manifesto, the image of a linked chain,as crimping is a tool used to unite the individual links of a linked chain. As artists, processes are the chain that link us together. Each link is different, but they fit together and hold strong all the same. Without ideas to draw inspiration from, the chain falls apart, for a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
